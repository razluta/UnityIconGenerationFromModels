## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting (Updated for v1.2.0)

### Quality Issues
**Poor icon quality despite High Quality settings**
- Check that your materials support the selected rendering features
- Verify anti-aliasing is working (check render pipeline compatibility)
- Use render scale > 1.0 for super-sampling
- Enable HDR for better lighting quality
- Check shadow settings if using shadow-casting lights

**Icons appear pixelated or blurry**
- Increase anti-aliasing level (try 8x or 16x MSAA)
- Use higher render scale (1.2x - 1.5x)
- Ensure main icon size matches your target use case
- Check that additional sizes are being generated correctly

### Multi-Folder Issues
**"No prefabs found" message**
- Check that each folder path is correct and accessible
- Verify prefab name prefixes match your actual prefab names
- Make sure prefabs are in the specified folders (not subfolders)
- Check that folders are enabled in the configuration

**Some folders not processing**
- Verify each folder is enabled (checkbox in UI)
- Check folder validation messages in the reports
- Ensure all folder paths exist and are accessible
- Review generation reports for folder-specific errors

### Performance Issues
**Generation taking too long**
- Switch to Draft quality preset for faster processing
- Reduce anti-aliasing level (use 2x or 4x instead of 16x)
- Disable shadows and HDR for speed
- Enable memory optimization
- Process folders in smaller batches

**Out of memory errors**
- Enable memory optimization in advanced settings
- Use lower render scales
- Process fewer prefabs at once
- Close other Unity windows during generation
- Use lower icon resolutions for testing

### Report Issues
**Reports not generating**
- Check that "Enable Reports" is turned on
- Verify write permissions to the Reports folder
- Check Unity Console for detailed error messages
- Try manually creating the Reports folder in your project directory

**Missing performance metrics**
- Ensure generation completed successfully
- Check that timing information is available in logs
- Verify reports are being saved (check Reports folder)

### General Issues
**"Generate Icons" button disabled**
- Check validation messages - resolve all warnings/errors
- Ensure at least one input folder is configured and valid
- Verify output folder is selected and accessible
- Check that prefab name prefixes are not empty

**Generated icons in wrong format**
- Check Export Format dropdown in Output Settings
- PNG recommended for most use cases
- TGA for professional/engine pipelines

**Missing size variants**
- Verify additional sizes are added in Output Settings
- Check output folder for files with size suffixes (e.g., `_256x256`)
- Ensure sufficient disk space for multiple large files

**Black icons instead of transparent backgrounds**
- Ensure background color alpha is set to 0
- Check that your materials support transparency
- Verify render texture format supports alpha channel
- Test with simple materials first

### Scene and Lighting Issues
**Scene mockup not working**
- Ensure you have an active scene open
- Check Console for error messages about scene operations
- Try closing and reopening the tool window
- Verify Unity scene management permissions

**Objects appear too small/large in icons**
- Enable "Auto Fit" for automatic scaling
- Adjust "Object Scale" manually in advanced settings
- Use scene mockup to visually adjust camera position/FOV
- Check per-folder custom transform settings

**Poor lighting/shadows**
- Use "Setup Scene Mockup" to visually adjust lighting
- Try different lighting presets (Studio, Product Shot, etc.)
- Add point lights for accent lighting
- Adjust main light and fill light directions and intensities
- Use "Capture Preview" to test lighting before batch generation

### Memory and Performance Optimization
**Tool freezing during generation**
- Enable memory optimization
- Process prefabs in smaller batches
- Close other Unity windows during generation
- Use lower icon resolutions (128x128) for testing
- Monitor system memory usage

**Slow preview generation**
- Use Draft quality for previews
- Reduce preview size temporarily
- Disable unnecessary visual effects
- Use fewer point lights in lighting setup

## üí° Best Practices (v1.2.0)

### Quality Management
**Start with presets, then customize**
- Choose appropriate quality preset for your use case
- Use Draft for rapid iteration and testing
- Switch to High Quality for final production renders
- Monitor performance impact indicators

**Quality vs Speed Balance**
- Use Standard quality for most production work
- Reserve High Quality for hero assets or marketing materials
- Use Draft quality during development and testing
- Consider render scale for super-sampling when needed

### Multi-Folder Organization
**Organize by asset type**
- Separate folders for weapons, armor, consumables, etc.
- Use consistent prefab naming conventions
- Configure folder-specific transform settings when needed
- Save different configurations for different asset categories

**Efficient batch processing**
- Group similar assets in the same folders
- Use consistent transform settings when possible
- Process related assets together for efficiency
- Test with small batches before full production runs

### Lighting & Visual Setup
**Professional lighting workflow**
- Start with lighting presets for consistent results
- Use scene mockup extensively for visual feedback
- Capture previews to test different configurations
- Iterate quickly with preset ‚Üí mockup ‚Üí preview ‚Üí adjust cycle

**Lighting best practices**
- Combine presets with manual adjustments for unique looks
- Use Studio preset for clean, professional results
- Try Product Shot for e-commerce style icons
- Use Dramatic preset for hero assets and marketing

### Output & Format Management
**Size planning strategy**
- Choose main size based on primary target platform
- Add common variants (64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024)
- Consider platform-specific requirements (iOS, Android, PC, Console)
- Test file sizes for large variants (2048x2048+)

**Format selection guidelines**
- Use PNG for most projects (better compression, wider compatibility)
- Consider TGA for game engines requiring uncompressed formats
- PNG preferred for UI systems and web use
- TGA better for professional pipelines requiring exact pixel data

### Project Organization
**Configuration management**
- Save configurations for different asset types ("WeaponIcons.json", "ArmorIcons.json")
- Share configurations with team for consistent visual style
- Version control configuration files alongside your project
- Document your standard configurations for team reference

**Workflow optimization**
- Test with one prefab first before running full batch generation
- Use reports to identify and fix common issues
- Set up automated quality checks using generation reports
- Create standard operating procedures for your team

### Performance Optimization
**Processing efficiency**
- Use memory optimization for large batches
- Process similar assets together
- Monitor generation reports for performance bottlenecks
- Close unnecessary Unity windows during processing

**Quality optimization**
- Profile different quality settings for your specific assets
- Use render scale strategically (higher for small details, standard for large objects)
- Balance anti-aliasing with processing time requirements
- Consider HDR only when lighting quality is critical
